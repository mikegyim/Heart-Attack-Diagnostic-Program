This heart attack diagnostic program determines if a patient has heart attack or is at risk of getting heart attack.
It uses the blood sample from the patient to determine the troponin level in the blood
since the troponin level can be used to determine the heart attack status of a patient.
And also determine the cholesterol level and the diabetic status of the patient 
since people with high level of cholesterol and or are diabetic has a high chance of getting silent heart attack.
